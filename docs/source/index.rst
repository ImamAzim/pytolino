**Pytolino** is a client to interact (login, upload, delete ebooks, etc..) with the tolino cloud with python. Most of the code is forked from `tolino-calibre-sync project <https://github.com/darkphoenix/tolino-calibre-sync>`_

One difference is that I aim to create a python package from it and to put it on pypi, so that one can use this python module in other projects.

Features
========

* login to tolino partner (for now works only with buecher.de)
